### What we do

We as students take care of making a web page collecting data of the official page of Statsbomb respecting all the rights of said company. We have collected all possible match filters provided by Statsbomb. We have the following filters to consult on our website: <br> <br>
<b>+ Percentage of Possession:</b> In this endpoint you must enter the id of the match, so it will return the percentage of possession of the match. <br> <br>
<b>+ Matches Date:</b> In this endpoint you must enter the id of the competition, the id of the season and the date from which you want to list all the matches. <br> <br>
<b>+ Matches Date:</b> This endpoint is responsible for listing all the points of the manager indicated in the parameter. <br> <br>
